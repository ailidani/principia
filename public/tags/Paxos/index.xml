Dynamic Paxos (Multi-Paxos that supports reconfig) limits the number of concurrent proposals as a pipeline length parameter $\alpha &amp;gt; 0$, therefore a configuration change chosen at instance $i$ does not take effect until instance $i + \alpha$. Raft protocol supports unbounded pipeline by limiting reconfiguration operations to be only add or remove one node at a time.</description></item><item><title>What Paxos sounds like</title><link>/docs/sonification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/sonification/</guid><description>Sonification is the use of non-speech audio to convey information or perceptualize data. Auditory perception has advantages in temporal, spatial, amplitude, and frequency resolution that open possibilities as an alternative or complement to visualization techniques. &amp;ndash; Wikipedia
Following simple rules, to assign different audio frequencies to meaningful events or state changes in a computer program, we were able to clearly hear the &amp;ldquo;characteristic&amp;rdquo; and pattern that distinguish them, like the sorting algorithms in this video.</description></item></channel></rss>
