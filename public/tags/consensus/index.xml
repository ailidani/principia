While providing the same scalable performance of NoSQL systems, they still maintain strong consistency guarantees by relying upon some forms of wide area network (WAN) coordination service. Among them, ZooKeeper 2 is the most popular coordination service used in many projects in Facebook and Apache.</description></item><item><title>Paxos Reconfiguration</title><link>/docs/paxos_reconfiguration/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/paxos_reconfiguration/</guid><description>Introduction # There have been several approaches to dynamic reconfiguration of consensus algorithms. Dynamic Paxos (Multi-Paxos that supports reconfig) limits the number of concurrent proposals as a pipeline length parameter $\alpha &amp;gt; 0$, therefore a configuration change chosen at instance $i$ does not take effect until instance $i + \alpha$. Raft protocol supports unbounded pipeline by limiting reconfiguration operations to be only add or remove one node at a time.</description></item></channel></rss>
